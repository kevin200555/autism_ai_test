# About
A flutter project whose purpose is to integrate an AI model that is training to detect autism.  The AI model takes data from videos and questionaires and based on that data, it can detect how whether or not someone has autism.  This program collects that data.  It takes videos that the user records  and gets questionaires through integrated surveys on the app.
