# autism_ai_test

# About
A flutter project whose purpose is to integrate an AI model that is training to detect autism.  The AI model takes data from videos and questionaires and based on that data, it can detect how whether or not someone has autism.  This program collects that data.  It takes videos that the user records and gets questionaires through integrated surveys on the app.

# The AI Model
The AI Model was developed by Dr. Shou Wang at Washington University St. Louis.  Of course, no AI model is perfect, but this model, if trained and integrated properly would act as a good first line screening to detect any early signs of autism before a child is properly diagonsed.  Therefore, this model is tested and mostly designed to detect autism in young children.
