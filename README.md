# autism_ai_test

## About
`autism_ai_test` is a Flutter-based application designed to integrate an AI model for early autism screening. The app collects both video data and questionnaire responses from users, which are then analyzed by the AI to detect potential early signs of autism. While this app does not replace a professional diagnosis, it provides a convenient first-line screening tool that can alert parents, caregivers, or healthcare professionals to potential concerns at an early stage.

The app allows users to record videos of a child’s behavior in various scenarios and complete integrated surveys and questionnaires. The data collected is securely processed to ensure user privacy while enabling the AI model to provide insights into developmental patterns that may be associated with autism.

This project is still a work-in-progress and invovles a collaboration with multiple programmers.

## The AI Model
The underlying AI model was developed by Dr. Shou Wang at Washington University in St. Louis. It leverages video analysis and questionnaire data to identify patterns indicative of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in young children. Although no AI system can provide a definitive diagnosis, this model has been trained and validated to function as an effective early screening tool.

The AI works by analyzing behavioral cues in recorded videos, such as facial expressions, gestures, and social interaction patterns, combined with responses from structured questionnaires. These features are processed to provide a risk assessment score, which can guide caregivers toward seeking further evaluation by a qualified professional.

## Features
- **Video Recording:** Capture short clips of a child’s behavior in natural settings.  
- **Integrated Questionnaires:** User-friendly surveys designed to capture developmental information relevant to autism detection.  
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses advanced machine learning techniques to assess the likelihood of autism indicators.  
- **Early Warning System:** Provides actionable insights to help parents and caregivers decide whether to seek professional evaluation.  
- **Secure Data Handling:** All user data is processed securely, with privacy and confidentiality prioritized.  

## Goals
The primary goal of `autism_ai_test` is to facilitate early detection and intervention for autism, improving outcomes for children by encouraging timely assessment and support. This app is intended as a supportive tool for caregivers and medical professionals, helping to bridge the gap between initial concerns and professional diagnosis.
